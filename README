Crunch
======

An easier way to perform calculations inside Vim

GitHub
------
The most up to date version of this plugin can be found here:
https://github.com/arecarn/crunch



Overview
--------

Crunch makes calculations in Vim more accessible and loosens Vim's math syntax. Most of Crunch's looser syntax is accomplished by extensive search and replace. Crunch also forces floating point to be used.

Requirements: Vim compiled with +float feature.

Crunch allows you to just type in mathematical expressions without having to worry about the syntax as much.

Usage
-----

:Crunch <args>

Where is some mathematical expression to be evaluated. The result is then available to be pasted from the default register.

:Crunch

Crunch then gives you the following prompt in the command line: Calc >> for you to enter you mathematical expression. The result is then available to be pasted from the default register.

:CrunchLine, :'<'>CrunchLine, or <leader>cl

Crunch Uses the current line or the visually selected lines as the expression(s) and adds the result to the end of the line(s). When the expression(s) changes using :CrunchLine again will reevaluate the line(s)

:CrunchBlock, or <leader>cb

Crunch Uses the current paragraph (block of text starting and ending with an empty line) as the expressions and adds the result to the end of the lines. When a expressions in a paragraph changes using :CrunchBlock again will reevaluate them
